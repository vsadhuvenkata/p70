        <h1>Rukmini Devi <br>
            <h2>Rukmini Devi Arundale was an Indian classical dancer who led the renaissance of the ‘Bharatnatyam’ dance form and founded the Kalakshetra Foundation in Madras (now Chennai). She was also a theosophist who was greatly inspired by Annie Besant, the Theosophical Society’s British cofounder and president. Born into an upper class Brahmin family in India, she grew up in an environment where she was exposed to dance, music and culture. Her father was involved with the theosophical society and soon the young girl too followed suit.</h2>
